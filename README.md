# ðŸ§  Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive **Python-based visualization tool** that demonstrates the inner workings of popular sorting algorithms in real-time. Built using **PyOpenGL** and **PyGLUT**, this visualizer offers an intuitive graphical representation of how various sorting techniques rearrange data step-by-step.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time animation of sorting algorithms
- Color-coded bars representing array values
- Keyboard controls to interact with the visualizer
- Toggle between ascending and descending sort
- Displays current algorithm name and time complexity

## ðŸ§© Sorting Algorithms Included

| Algorithm        | Time Complexity (Average/Worst) |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Bubble Sort      | O(nÂ²)                       |
| Insertion Sort   | O(nÂ²)                       |
| Selection Sort   | O(nÂ²)                       |
| Merge Sort       | O(n log n)                  |
| Quick Sort       | O(n log n) / O(nÂ²)          |
